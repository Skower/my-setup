# Setup

This repository contains my setup scripts for my current workflow on ubuntu based distros.
It uses Ansible in order to automate the setup process. This setup is based on [ThePrimeagen's one](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/ansible).

- ``ansible-install`` bash script that install ansible
- Use ``ansible-playbook setup.yml`` to install everything
